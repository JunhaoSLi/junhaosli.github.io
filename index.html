	            <p><b>A Little About Myself</b><br>
	                  I am a first-generation Chinese man, born in Georgia and raised in Hawaii. I discovered computer programming in high school and decided I wanted to do it for a lifetime which leads me to where I'm at now: college sophomore majoring in C.S. at NU. At the moment, I'm searching for an internship for the upcoming summer.</p>

		        <p><b>Education &amp; Extracurriculars</b><br>
	        	    I'm currently finishing up the core C.S. curriculum at Northwestern and beginning to take more higher level courses.<br>
	        	    <br>
	        	    Some courses I've taken are: 
	        	    <ul>
	        	     	<li>Data Structures and Management</li>
	        	     	<li>Computer Systems</li>
	        	     	<li>Human Computer Interaction</li>
	        	     	<li>Machine Perception of Music</li>
	        	    </ul>
	        	    I work at the Northwestern IT Support Center as a consultant. We provide technical support over phone, email, and chat to NU faculty, staff, other students, etc. <br>
					<br>
	        	    I am also the treasurer for the IEEE student group at Northwestern and a mentor for the Chinacare orgnization.</p>

	    		<p><b>Projects</b><br>
	    			<a href="http://github.com/JaredFern/PocketIan">Pocket Ian</a>: A simple Facbook chat bot that my three teammates and I created during Wildhacks 2016. The bot uses Flask and was run on Heroku. I helped with data scraping university websites and writing the bot's question handling code.<br>
	    			<br>
	    			<a href="http://ieee.northwestern.edu/">IEEE Website</a>: As a freshman, I worked in a team of three to create the website for the Northwestern IEEE student group over a ten-week period. The process allowed me to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript/Github and gave me experience with working on a team project.<br>
	    			<br>
	    			<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzTDgZX-wVgpYmJOZVU1UkRQNUE/view">DTC Project</a>: In my Design, Thinking, and Communication course, my teammates and I designed a device to help people who have lost control in one of their legs put on their shoes. Tasked with a real-world issue from a client, we went through the design process which included client/user interviews, proper documentation, mockups, and more.
